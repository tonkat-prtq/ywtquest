# OmniAuth - Rails CSRF Protection

This gem provides a mitigation against CVE-2015-9284 (Cross-Site Request
Forgery on the request phrase when using OmniAuth gem with a Ruby on Rails
application) by implementing a CSRF token verifier that directly utilize
`ActionController::RequestForgeryProtection` code from Rails.

## Usage

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "omniauth-rails_csrf_protection"
```

Then run `bundle install` to install this gem.

You will then need to verify that all links in your application that would
initiate OAuth request phrase are being converted to a HTTP POST form that
contains `authenticity_token` value. This might simply be done by changing all
`link_to` to `button_to`, or use `link_to ..., method: :post`.

## Under the Hood

This gem does a few things to your application:

* Disable access to the OAuth request phrase using HTTP GET method.
* Insert a Rails CSRF token verifier at before request phrase.

These actions mitigate you from the attack vector described in CVE-2015-9284.
